    <h1>HTML blockquote for Quotations</h1>
    <p>The HTML blockquote element defines a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent blockquote elements.</p>
    <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
    For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
    The world's leading conservation organization,
    WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
    1.2 million members in the United States and
    close to 5 million globally.
    </blockquote>

        Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.
