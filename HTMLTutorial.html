    <h1>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h1>
    <pre>
        There are two display values: block and inline
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
        An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
        The div element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
        The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
    </pre>

    <h1>HTML class Attribute</h1>
    <pre>
        The HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element
        Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements
        The class attribute can be used on any HTML element
        The class name is case sensitive
        Different HTML elements can point to the same class name
        JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method
    </pre>

    <h1>HTML id Attribute</h1>
    <pre>
        The id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element
        The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document
        The id attribute is used by CSS and JavaScript to style/select a specific element
        The value of the id attribute is case sensitive
        The id attribute is also used to create HTML bookmarks
        JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method
