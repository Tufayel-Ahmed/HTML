    <h1>HTML Headings</h1>
    <p>HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.</p>
    <p>HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags. h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading.</p>
    <p>Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.</p>

    <h1>Headings Are Important</h1>
    <p>Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. <br>
        Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure. <br>    
        h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on. <br>  
        Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.</p>

    <h1>Bigger Heading</h1>
    <p>Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:</p>
    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
